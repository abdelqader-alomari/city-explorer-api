## Credit and Collaborations

I make a graph and discuss for first 30 minutes with: Marah Musleh

## Time Estimates

- Feature 1: Set up your server repository.

It took around 2 hours planning + setup server (almost expected)

- Feature 2: Show weather on server (backend):

It took around 5 hours (with huge try and error to solve it!),
I expect 2 hours not 5 to solve ! it seems it straight forward but it's tricky

- Feature 3: Errors (show clear errors to understand):

  It takes 2 hours as expected.
